# `ohco2`

The `edu.holycross.shot.ohco2` package is a library written in Scala for  working with collections of texts in the OHCO2 model.

## Current state of the library

Currently in very rudimentary form only.

It uses `sbt` for its build system, and `scalatest` for unit testing. Run all tests with `sbt test`; build scaladocs with `sbt doc`.
